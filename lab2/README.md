**Requirements:**

1. The website should be partly responsive:
    - Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens).
    - Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.
2. The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens
3. The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).
4. Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS canâ€™t be in just one-two files)
5. All of the previous work requirements must be kept.
